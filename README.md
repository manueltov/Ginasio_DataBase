# Ginasio_DB
This project was made by Daniel Nunes, Inês Gonçalves, João Rangel and me.
And the purpose was to 'SIBD - Sistemas de Informação e Base de Dados', a subject of our Computer Science Course in Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon.
In this subject we learned to design a data base, to diagram it, to create it, and use it. The programming language used is the SQL with Oracle Databases.

This project was made so we could practise the things we learned in the classroom.

Ginasio_DB is a data base made to manage gyms (classes, spaces, users, workers, salary, historic of classes, bills,...)

# ETAPA 1
In this first part of the project we designed the data base, understanding the problem and finding solutions. And we have also done several diagrams and discuss them so we could improve. In this first part we also have plan the 'RIAs' (Restrições Identidade Associação).
And finally we started creating the data base, with SQL-DDL.

# ETAPA 2
In this second part of the project we used the SQL-DML to do some Queries / Selects , and also create some Packages to manipulate the data base.
